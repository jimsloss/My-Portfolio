Previously Button style changed on hover, but this change reverted when moved from button. So changed in javascript file instead.
Took more thought as had to change all buttons when mouse moved over different button. Decided not to use onclick as seemed,
mouseover was better experience. This change also ensured that when the page was first loaded the first button was highlighted,
showing which project was on display.

Previously the images disappeared on mouseout, thought this was a nice touch but it turned out to be annoying as the page just seemed
to jump a lot. So changed this so that the project section was always displayed. 

Also resized images in project section as it was annoying that the section kept changing in height with each project displayed.

Overall I am happier with the user experience.

Nuff said.
